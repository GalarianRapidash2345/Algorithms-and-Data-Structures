<h1>Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>
  
<p>This artifact is for the Algorithms and Data Structures category. The second artifact enhancement for the ePortfolio consists of applying algorithms and data structures theory to a project. 
  The artifact utilized for using algorithms and data structures is the fourth milestone of CS 405: Secure Coding. Within this milestone, a data structure for a collection and algorithms that coincide with the data structure utilize unit testing methods. 
  In addition to the unit testing methods, various input validation methods implement security for creating secure code. 
  I started this artifact in August of 2021. 
  This artifact was made relatively recently, which shows my current safe coding abilities.</p>

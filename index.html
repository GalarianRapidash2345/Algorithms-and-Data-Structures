<h1>Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>
  
<p>This artifact is for the Algorithms and Data Structures category. The second artifact enhancement for the ePortfolio consists of applying algorithms and data structures theory to a project. 
  The artifact utilized for using algorithms and data structures is the fourth milestone of CS 405: Secure Coding. Within this milestone, a data structure for a collection and algorithms that coincide with the data structure utilize unit testing methods. 
  In addition to the unit testing methods, various input validation methods implement security for creating secure code. 
  I started this artifact in August of 2021. 
  This artifact was made relatively recently, which shows my current safe coding abilities.</p>

<p>The original artifact's functionality overview consists of testing a data structure named collection and testing various algorithms. 
  The algorithm tests include positive and negative tests to check fundamentals on capacity, index sizes out of bounds, and entry size. 
  The features of the original artifact include tests using ASSERT, EXPECT, input validation conditions, along with minimal C++ coding standards. 
  In addition, the functionality within the original artifact utilizes principles of Quality Assurance that enhance efficiency further.</p>

<p>In addition to the original artifact, the artifact was improved with enhancements. 
  The ePortfolio then justifies the inclusion and the implementation of the enhanced artifact. 
  The reasons I selected this item include the artifact illustrating the advanced application of algorithms and data structures, the demonstration of secure coding principles within the artifact, and the artifact containing relevant industry skills for a career in Software Engineering. 
  The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures are the unit tests for the data structure and the unit tests for the various algorithms. The data structure tests are instantiated using object-oriented programming techniques and use assertions for input validation. 
  Each data structure test either determines the data structure to be empty or has an allocation size. The algorithm tests contain similar statements for input validation, and each algorithm test either verifies entries or tests the bounds of the data structure. 
  The functionality of these tests shows my abilities to create data structures and algorithms properly with advanced skills, such as combining the initialization of the data structures and algorithms with unit testing methods. How the artifact has improved is through the addition of efficiency checking for the unit tests. 
  I ran the artifact through the tool CppCheck, which analyzed the artifact's vulnerabilities, style, and performance issues. 
  The artifact utilized C++ coding standards to replace strings with symbolics, deallocate memory, add large entries to the collection data structure, and test all indexes, subscripts, along with pointers against the array, record, and file bounds. 
  These improvements eliminated most vulnerabilities and warnings within the CppCheck tool. 
  The artifact is conclusive to be suited to the ePortfolio, as the industry-related components and enhancements are pragmatic for algorithms and data structures.</p>

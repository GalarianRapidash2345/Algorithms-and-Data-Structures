# Algorithms and Data Structures

The second artifact enhancement for the ePortfolio consists of applying algorithms and data structures theory to a project. The artifact utilized for applying algorithms and data structures is the fourth milestone of the course CS 405: Secure Coding. Within this milestone, a data structure for a collection and algorithms that coincide with the data structure are tested using unit testing methods. In addition to the unit testing methods, various input validation methods are used for creating secure code. This artifact was created in August of 2021. This artifact was created quite recently, which shows my current secure coding abilities.

The original artifact's functionality overview consists of testing a data structure named collection and testing various algorithms. The algorithm tests include positive and negative tests to check fundamentals on capacity; index sizes out of bounds, and entry size. The features of the original artifact include tests using ASSERT, EXPECT, input validation conditions, and minimal C++ coding standards. In addition, the functionality within the original artifact utilizes principles of Quality Assurance that enhance efficiency further.

The inclusion of the artifact for the ePortfolio is justified through the factors demonstrated within the artifact that proved the artifact to suffice. The reasons I selected this item include the artifact illustrating the advanced application of algorithms and data structures, the demonstration of secure coding principles within the artifact, and the artifact contains relevant industry skills for a career in Software Engineering. The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures are the unit tests for the data structure and the unit tests for the various algorithms. The data structure tests are instantiated using object-oriented programming techniques and use assertions for input validation. Each data structure test either determines the data structure to be empty or has an allocation size. The algorithm tests contain similar assertions for input validation. Each algorithm test either verifies entries or tests the bounds of the data structure. The functionality of these tests shows my abilities to create data structures and algorithms properly with advanced skills, such as combining the initialization of the data structures and algorithms with unit testing methods. How the artifact has improved is through the addition of efficiency checking for the unit tests. The artifact was run through the tool CppChecker, which analyzed the vulnerabilities, style, and performance issues within the artifact. The artifact utilized C++ coding standards to replace strings with symbolics, deallocate memory, add large entries to the collection data structure, and for testing all indexes, subscripts, and pointers against the array, record, and file bounds. These improvements had eliminated most vulnerabilities and warnings within the CppChecker tool. It is conclusive that the artifact is suited to the ePortfolio, as the industry-related components and improvements are pragmatic for algorithms and data structures.

The enhanced artifact functionality consists of improving the data structure, improving an algorithm test, the tests for efficiency size out of bounds, refining the CanAddToEmptyVectorTest, and demonstrating how to analyze efficiency using analysis tools such as CppChecker. The collection class was redefined as a unique collection that will hold large entries. The tests that were enhanced include CanAddToEmptyVector and ExceptionCollectionSizeOutOfBounds. In addition, the tests regarding capacity, entries, and size were enhanced for efficiency. The enhanced functionality utilized large data to test the performance of the collection algorithms interacting with the data structure. These initial enhancements have increased the style and performance coinciding with the efficiency as well.

The overall development process consists of initializing a new data structure test, a new algorithm test, the refining of the CanAddToEmptyVector test, and an exception test. Within the new source files I created, I had implemented the new tests and used C++ coding standards to improve the artifact. The updates I have to my outcome-coverage plans include instantiating a new class for the unique collection data structure and creating a new testing environment that will allow the enhancement source files to be executed. Reflecting on the process of enhancing the artifact, I gained a broader understanding of how to implement algorithms and data structures. What I learned as I was creating and improving the artifact consisted of the ability to use coding standards, unit tests, and analysis tools to verify the initialization of data structures and algorithms. In addition, I learned how to test larger amounts of data within a collection. The challenges I faced when creating the enhancements include several testing issues and type errors when initializing the new tests. The testing issues were resolved by deallocating the data structure test instead of adding more data to the test. The type errors were resolved by using the command size() to initialize data instead of retrieving the data with the command get(). By resolving the challenges, it is conclusive that I have gained the skills to use algorithms and data structures in advanced applications.
